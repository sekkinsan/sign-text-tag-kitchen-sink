A compilation of text tagging resources and samples for Adobe Acrobat Sign

Adobe Sign text tags are specially formatted text that can be placed anywhere within the content of your document specifying the location, size, type of fields such as signature and initial fields, check boxes, radio buttons and form fields; and advanced optional field processing rules. Text tags can also be used when creating PDFs with form fields. 

Text tags are converted into Adobe Sign form fields when the document is sent for signature or uploaded. Adobe Sign text tags can be placed in any document type such as PDF, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel and text files (.txt, .rtf). 

This text tagging guide provides examples for all of your text tagging options.  All you need to do is simply upload this document into Adobe Sign and send for Signature.  You will then be able to see real life examples from the tags below and see how they look in the signing environment.
